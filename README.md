# Competitive Programming
This repository contains all the codes and programs of my competitive programming life. This includes Algorithm & and data structure theoretical coding, solutions to different online judge's problems, and supplementary topics.

Checklist:
  1. Can I solve the sub-problem of that problem
  2. Can I solve the whole problem
  3. Do I check the parameter
  4. Did I clear all the memory
  5. check whether DP is cleared
  6. Understand the prob?! check again!!!
